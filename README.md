# Galleria Saves The Planet

##Storyline

Galleria(she/them) is in a world where people care more about themselves than the planet they live on. Thats why Galleria goes to the beach and tries to do her best to make it better and picks up trash, showing that there are still some good people in this world. Picking up trash gets them closer to saving the planet!
HOWEVER, the people on the beach get in Galleria's way as she tries to pick up the trash and when she bumps into them trash falls out. 

Moves: Move Galleria up and down to help her pick up trash and avoid hitting the people laying on the beach
